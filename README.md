# Sniffer-Code
This Python script uses Scapy to sniff network traffic and analyze packets in real-time. It captures IP, TCP, UDP, and DNS layers, logs source/destination IPs, extracts DNS queries, and inspects HTTP requests (GET/POST/HEAD) or raw payloads. Useful for basic network monitoring, debugging, and security analysis.
